# K-Means-Clustering

### K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms which is easiest to comprehend.

</br>

# Algorithm :

### 1. It randomly initializes k points (a.k.a centroids) in the data-plane, where k is number of clusters you want to detect.

### 2. Every data-point is then assigned to one of the centroids which is nearest to it.

### 3. The average of all the points belonging to same centroid is computed.

### 4. The centroid is then shifted to the average computed above.

### 5. Steps 2 to 4 is repeated till centroid doesn't change its location in an iteration.
